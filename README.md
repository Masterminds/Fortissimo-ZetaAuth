#Fortissimo handlers for ZetaComponents Authentication

This provides Fortissimo commands to wrap the Authentication library
from ZetaComponents.

EXPERIMENTAL

## Usage

Use composer, and add Masterminds/Fortissimo-ZetaAuth to your project.


## TODO

This is a *very* basic implementation. The main check command should be
broken out to allow different session ahndler and to support a chain of
filters. While none of this is hard, all of it is outside of my current
needs.
